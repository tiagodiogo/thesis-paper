abstract = {A wireless sensor network is a group of network nodes which collaborate with each other in a sophisticated fashion. It is built of nodes from a few to several hundreds or even thousands, where each node is connected to one (or sometimes several) sensors. In WSN, Second layer of the OSI reference layer is a data link layer which has a sub layer of Medium Access Control. The choice of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol has a direct bearing on the reliability and efficiency of network transmissions due to errors and interferences in wireless communications and to other challenges. They are primarily responsible for regulating access to the shared medium. There are a lot of protocols developed to protect from DOS attack, but it is not completely possible. One such DOS attack is vampire attacks which cause damage in network. Secure level is low; productivity reduces which leads to environmental disasters and cause loss in the information. Routing protocols play an important role in modern wireless communication networks. Hence propose Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) where router used it to exchange routing data within an independent system. In WSN routing protocols find the route between nodes and ensure the consistent communication between the nodes in the network.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) with emphasis on enabling technologies, protocols and application issues. The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},

abstract = {In today's world of home automation, smart objects are interconnected and participate in the Internet of Things. Being part of a very sensible eco-system, these entities must be secured against various kinds of attacks. Smart home appliances such as light bulbs or window shutters have very low processing power and networking capacities and more often than not lack of input/output devices such as keyboards or displays. Therefore, special protocols have been developed to enable lightweight and secure communication. Yet, the secure configuration of new nodes in a network has not been solved satisfactory. In this paper we present a three-phase protocol to bootstrap constrained devices in a wireless sensor network based on IPv6 and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). The protocol phases include service discovery, distribution of security credentials, and application-specific node configuration.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

With ContikiMAC, nodes can participate in network communication yet keep their radios turned off for roughly 99{\%} of the time. This report describes the ContikiMAC mechanism, measures the energy consump- tion of individual ContikiMAC operations, and evaluates the efficiency of the fast sleep and phase-lock optimiza- tions.},

By being able to estimate the energy consumption of the sensor nodes, applications and routing protocols are able to make informed decisions that increase the lifetime of the sensor network. However, it is in general not possible to measure the energy consumption on popular sensor node platforms. In this paper, we present and evaluate a software- based on-line energy estimation mechanism that estimates the energy consumption of a sensor node. We evaluate the mechanism by comparing the estimated energy consumption with the lifetime of capacitor-powered sensor nodes. By im- plementing and evaluating the X-MAC protocol, we show how software-based on-line energy estimation can be used to empirically evaluate the energy efficiency of sensor net- work protocols.},

As technology reaches everywhere, anyone can misuse it, and it is always essential to secure it. In this work we present a denial-of-service (DoS) detec- tion architecture for 6LoWPAN, the standard protocol designed by IETF as an adaptation layer for low-power lossy networks enabling low-power devices to communicate with the Internet. The proposed architecture integrates an intrusion detection system (IDS) into the network framework developed within the EU FP7 project ebbits. The aim is to detect DoS attacks based on 6LoWPAN. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, preliminary implementation was completed and tested against a real DoS attack using a penetration testing system. The paper concludes with the related results proving to be successful in detecting DoS attacks on 6LoWPAN. Further, extending the IDS could lead to detect more complex attacks on 6LoWPAN.},

abstract = {Responding to the increasing interest to connect wireless sensor networks (WSN) to the Internet, the IETF has proposed standards that enable IPv6-based sensor networks. Specifically, the IETF 6LoWPAN and RoLL working groups developed standards for en- capsulating IPv6 datagrams in 802.15.4 frames, neighbor discov- ery, and routing that allow sensor networks to exchange IPv6 data- grams with Internet hosts. However, given that these standards, es- pecially the RPL routing protocol, are relatively new, there has not yet been a study that measures the actual performance of these pro- posals using real implementations. In this work, we use the BLIP and TinyRPL implementations in TinyOS 2.x to evaluate the per- formance of the newly proposed standards and compare them with CTP, the de-facto routing protocol standard for TinyOS. Our results indicate that the performance of TinyRPL is comparable with CTP and at the same time, TinyRPL can provide additional functionali- ties that traditional WSN routing protocols could not provide. We also discovered several issues, relevant to system developers and the standardization groups, which can enhance the proposed stan- dards' performance.},

abstract = {To survive reboots, 802.15.4 security normally requires an 802.15.4 node to store both its anti-replay data and its frame counter in non-volatile memory. However, the only non-volatile memory on most 802.15.4 nodes is flash memory, which is energy consuming, slow, as well as prone to wear. Establishing session keys frees 802.15.4 nodes from storing anti-replay data and frame counters in non-volatile memory. For establishing pairwise session keys for use in 802.15.4 se-curity in particular, Krentz et al. proposed the Adaptable Pairwise Key Establishment Scheme (APKES). Yet, APKES neither supports reboots nor mobile nodes. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Key Establishment Scheme (AKES) to overcome these limitations of APKES. Above all, AKES makes 802.15.4 security survive reboots without storing data in non-volatile memory. Also, we implemented AKES for Contiki and demonstrate its memory and energy efficiency. Of independent interest, we resolve the issue that 802.15.4 security stops to work if a node's frame counter reaches its maximum value, as well as propose a technique for reducing the security-related per frame overhead.},

abstract = { Sleep deprivation attacks are a form of denial of service attack whereby an attacker renders a pervasive computing device inoperable by draining the battery more quickly than it would be drained under normal usage. We describe three main methods for an attacker to drain the battery: (1) service request power attacks, where repeated requests are made to the victim for services, typically over a network - even if the service is not provided the victim must expend energy deciding whether or not to honor the request; (2) benign power attacks, where the victim is made to execute a valid but energy-hungry task repeatedly, and (3) malignant power attacks, where the attacker modifies or creates an executable to make the system consume more energy than it would otherwise. Our initial results demonstrate the increased power consumption due to these attacks, which we believe are the first real examples of these attacks to appear in the literature. We also propose a power-secure architecture to thwart these power attacks by employing multi-level authentication and energy signatures.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a technology with high potential to be employed in several industrial and quotidian situations. Self-organization and self-configuration are key characteristics of WSNs. In most situations, these characteristics are useful because they minimize the configuration efforts and simultaneously increase the network robustness in case of failures or topology changes. However, they can also be exploited to perform security attacks, since third party nodes can easily join the network and, then, use it to compromise legitimate nodes and to send messages to the Internet. This paper presents a mechanism that can be used to control the nodes that have access to WSNs with 6LoWPAN support. It is based on administrative approval, preventing third party nodes from using the network to communicate with regular nodes. It uses standard protocols which are present in all 6LoWPAN compliant networks, such as 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discover protocol and RPL routing protocol. This paper also presents the design and deployment of a laboratory testbed that validates the proposed solution.},

abstract = {We have witnessed the Fixed Internet emerging with virtually every computer being connected today; we are currently witnessing the emergence of the Mobile Internet with the exponential explosion of smart phones, tablets and net-books. However, both will be dwarfed by the anticipated emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which everyday objects are able to connect to the Internet, tweet or be queried. Whilst the impact onto economies and societies around the world is undisputed, the technologies facilitating such a ubiquitous connectivity have struggled so far and only recently commenced to take shape. To this end, this paper introduces in a timely manner and for the first time the wireless communications stack the industry believes to meet the important criteria of power-efficiency, reliability and Internet connectivity. Industrial applications have been the early adopters of this stack, which has become the de- facto standard, thereby bootstrapping early IoT developments with already thousands of wireless nodes deployed. Corroborated throughout this paper and by emerging industry alliances, we believe that a standardized approach, using latest developments in the IEEE 802.15.4 and IETF working groups, is the only way forward.We introduce and relate key embodiments of the power-efficient IEEE 802.15.4-2006 PHY layer, the power- saving and reliable IEEE 802.15.4e MAC layer, the IETF 6LoW- PAN adaptation layer enabling universal Internet connectivity, the IETF ROLL routing protocol enabling availability, and finally the IETF CoAP enabling seamless transport and support of Internet applications. The protocol stack proposed in the present work converges towards the standardized notations of the ISO/OSI and TCP/IP stacks. What thus seemed impossible some years back, i.e., building a clearly defined, standards-compliant and Internet- compliant stack given the extreme restrictions of IoT networks, is commencing to become reality.},

Despite the immense popularity of smartphones and the fact that energy is the most crucial aspect in smartphone programming, the answer to the above question remains elusive. This paper first presents eprof, the first fine-grained energy profiler for smartphone apps. Compared to profiling the runtime of applications running on conventional computers, profiling energy consumption of applications running on smartphones faces a unique challenge, asynchronous power behavior, where the effect on a components power state due to a program entity lasts beyond the end of that program entity. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of eprof on two mobile OSes, Android and Windows Mobile. We then present an in-depth case study, the first of its kind, of six popular smartphones apps (including Angry-Birds, Facebook and Browser). Eprof sheds lights on internal energy dissipation of these apps and exposes surprising findings like 65{\%}-75{\%} of energy in free apps is spent in third-party advertisement modules. Eprof also reveals several wakelock bugs, a family of energy bugs in smartphone apps, and effectively pinpoints their location in the source code. The case study highlights the fact that most of the energy in smartphone apps is spent in I/O, and I/O events are clustered, often due to a few routines. This motivates us to propose bundles, a new accounting presentation of app I/O energy, which helps the developer to quickly understand and optimize the energy drain of her app. Using the bundle presentation, we reduced the energy consumption of four apps by 20{\%} to 65{\%}.},

abstract = {The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks was recently introduced as the new routing standard for the Internet of Things. Although RPL defines basic security modes, it remains vulnerable to topological attacks which facilitate blackholing, interception, and resource exhaustion. We are concerned with analyzing the corresponding threats and protecting future RPL deployments from such attacks. Our contributions are twofold. First, we analyze the state of the art, in particular the protective scheme VeRA and present two new rank order attacks as well as extensions to mitigate them. Second, we derive and evaluate TRAIL, a generic scheme for topology authentication in RPL. TRAIL solely relies on the basic assumptions of RPL that (1) the root node serves as a trust anchor and (2) each node interconnects to the root in a straight hierarchy. Using proper reachability tests, TRAIL scalably and reliably identifies any topological attacker without strong cryptographic efforts.},

abstract = {IPv4 is now a legacy protocol and all future growth and innovation on the Internet will occur over IPv6. It is necessary that enterprise organizations take immediate action to develop strategies for IPv6 adoption or risk compromising business agility and continuity - especially those organizations with public-facing content that rely on the Internet. Yet, anecdotal evidence and recent studies indicate that few organizations have taken actionable steps toward IPv6 adoption. The evidence further suggests a low sense of urgency and lack of understanding among IT decision makers of the potential consequences that IPv4 exhaustion will have on their organization's business model and competitiveness. An understanding of the IPv6 adoption readiness within organizations is needed so that incentives and programs can be put into place to raise the awareness of decision makers to the risks of not having an IPv6 strategy, and to inspire them to take action. This study is a call-to-action and seeks to increase awareness of the current state of IPv6 readiness of enterprise organizations by presenting the results of a multi-phase investigation into the IPv6 readiness and into the quality of IPv6 enablement of U.S. companies. In the first phase of the study, a survey was sent to the senior IT decision makers of 463 end-user enterprise organizations located in the North Carolina eastern region to measure organizational IPv6 readiness across five facets of organizational IPv6 preparedness. Data is presented on the levels of IPv6 readiness of these organizations as well the technological, organizational, and environmental factors associated with IPv6 adoption. In the second phase, the external facing Web services of the 1000 largest U.S. companies were investigated for IPv6 enablement and for IPv6 effectiveness using DNS query tools and a Web-based user experience monitoring platform. The resulting data from these tests is presented along with details for future work.},

A requirement for large-scaled deployment are extremely low-cost sensors though running with minimal resources regarding computational power, energy consumption, and memory size. Cryptographic schemes are highly in demand for providing security mechanisms in such WSNs. Asymmetric cryptography allows for flexible key management schemes at the cost of high resource demands whereas symmetric cryptography provides resource efficient solutions. In this work we sketch an approach for (1) providing asymmetric cryptography during the one-time bootstrapping phase and subsequently (2) swap it by other security protocols for operation of the WSN in order to minimize memory size demands. Our mechanism is based on dynamic code update, e.g. provided by the FlexCup plug-in for TinyOS.

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) enables a wide range of application scenarios with potentially critical actuating and sensing tasks, e.g., in the e-health domain. For communication at the application layer, resource-constrained devices are expected to employ the constrained application protocol (CoAP) that is currently being standardized at the Internet Engineering Task Force. To protect the transmission of sensitive information, secure CoAP mandates the use of datagram transport layer security (DTLS) as the underlying security protocol for authenticated and confidential communication. DTLS, however, was originally designed for comparably powerful devices that are interconnected via reliable, high-bandwidth links. In this paper, we present Lithe-an integration of DTLS and CoAP for the IoT. With Lithe, we additionally propose a novel DTLS header compression scheme that aims to significantly reduce the energy consumption by leveraging the 6LoWPAN standard. Most importantly, our proposed DTLS header compression scheme does not compromise the end-to-end security properties provided by DTLS. Simultaneously, it considerably reduces the number of transmitted bytes while maintaining DTLS standard compliance. We evaluate our approach based on a DTLS implementation for the Contiki operating system. Our evaluation results show significant gains in terms of packet size, energy consumption, processing time, and network-wide response times when compressed DTLS is enabled.},

Emerging solution provides privacy breach minimization by supervised learning through training that incurs higher capex and opex. IoT systems do not consist of human-in-loop. So, involuntary approach of privacy preservation is to be employed. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for addressing the problem of involuntary privacy breaching risk minimization in smart energy management systems. Our proposed solution `Dynamic Privacy Analyzer' scheme is an attempt towards achieving a unique privacy metric that is derived from fundamental principles like robust statistics and information theory. We analyze the performance of our scheme with large set of publicly available real smart meter datasets and evaluate optimality criteria like utility-privacy trade-off. Efficacy of our proposed scheme is demonstrated by minimizing the capability of privacy intruders like NILM. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time the involuntary privacy-aware scheme tailored for IoT system is proposed. Our proposed scheme is generic enough to suit in other IoT applications.},

These "Vampire" attacks are not specific to any specific protocol, but rather rely on the properties of many popular classes of routing protocols. We find that all examined protocols are susceptible to Vampire attacks, which are devastating, difficult to detect, and are easy to carry out using as few as one malicious insider sending only protocol-compliant messages. In the worst case, a single Vampire can increase network-wide energy usage by a factor of O(N), where N in the number of network nodes. We discuss methods to mitigate these types of attacks, including a new proof-of-concept protocol that provably bounds the damage caused by Vampires during the packet forwarding phase.},

The Constrained Application Protocol, ZigBee IP, and Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LWM2M) mandate its use for securing application traffic. There has been much debate in both the standardization and research communities on the applicability of DTLS to constrained environments. The main concerns are the communication overhead and latency of the DTLS handshake, and the memory footprint of a DTLS implementation. This paper provides a thorough performance evaluation of DTLS in different duty-cycled networks through real-world experimentation, emulation and analysis. In particular, we measure the duration of the DTLS handshake when using three duty cycling link-layer protocols: preamble-sampling, the IEEE 802.15.4 beacon-enabled mode and the IEEE 802.15.4e Time Slotted Channel Hopping mode. The reported results demonstrate surprisingly poor performance of DTLS in radio duty-cycled networks. Because a DTLS client and a server exchange more than 10 signaling packets, the DTLS handshake takes between a handful of seconds and several tens of seconds, with similar results for different duty cycling protocols. Moreover, because of their limited memory, typical constrained nodes can only maintain 3???5 simultaneous DTLS sessions, which highlights the need for using DTLS parsimoniously.},
